This directory (SrcofStable) contains:

README                  This file.

exogean.ini             a file that recapitulates all the options of the 
                        exogean program. Using this file saves having to type
                        all the options on the command line. To use it, simply 
                        place it in the directory where the program is executed. 
                        In this file, all options are left blank and need to be 
                        filled in. See the file exogean.ini.def for the default 
                        values of all options. Options typed on the command line 
                        overide those specified in the exogean.ini file. 
                        Note that this file must be present in the directory where
                        exogean is executed.

exogean.ini.def     the same as exogean.ini but with default values filled in. 

.ml, .mli files     the source code of Exogean.

Makefile	    the makefile of Exogean.

Example_files       a directory with example files to run Exogean.



To install Exogean
###################
1) You first need to install OCaml (http://caml.inria.fr/).

2) To produce the Exogean executable, type 'make'  (this is a verbose step).
 
3) To clean the present directory from unuseful files, type 'make clean'.



To run Exogean
###############
You must first compute alignments between the genomic sequence
and a set of protein sequences and/or mRNA sequences. The quality and 
completeness of the annotation will depend both on the quality of the genomic
sequence you are annotating, and of the alignments you have computed. 

For alignments of protein and mRNA sequences, we routinely use the blat 
program (Kent WJ. Genome Res. 2002 12:656-64) available at 
http://www.soe.ucsc.edu/~kent/ but other programs such as exonerate available 
at http://www.ebi.ac.uk/~guy/exonerate/ or Blast will also work fine. See the 
exogean help page (exogean -h) for details on input file formats.

As an example, here are the blat parameters we used for the EGASP competition:

** to align mouse protein sequences against human genomic DNA: 

blat dna.fa prot.mask.fa outfile.psl -t=dnax -q=prot -mask=lower 
-noHead -tileSize=7 -oneOff=1

and from this only HSPs of size larger than 25 bp are retained.

** to align human mRNAs sequences against human genomic DNA:

blat dna.fa mrna.fa outfile.psl -t=dna -q=dna -noHead -fine -minIdentity=98 
-ooc=11.ooc -trimHardA -trimT -extendThroughN


For aligning, it is best if protein repeats are masked (e.g. with the seg 
program) but the fasta file given to exogean with the -bqp option should be 
unmasked. Protein names should not contain "pipe" signs. Protein sequences
must only contain single letter amino acid codes, or "x" or "X" signs for 
masked regions. No stops, no "*" signs. 


Here is an example of Exogean command line execution 

./exogean -o gtf:ENm002_vs_Gbkmrna_IPImouse.exo -gseq Example_files/ENm002_Build35.fa 
-hspp exf:Example_files/ENm002_vs_IPImouse.exf -bqp Example_files/ENm002_ipi.MOUSE_bq.fa 
-hspa psl:Example_files/ENm002_vs_Gbkmrna.psl 


For getting help about how to use Exogean

./exogean -h
